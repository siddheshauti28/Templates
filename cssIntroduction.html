<h2>CSS Sloved a Big Problem </h2>
<p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p> 
<p>HTML was created to discribe the content of a web page , like:</p>
<p><strong>h1</strong> This is a heading <strong>h1</strong></p>
<p><strong>p</strong> This is a paragraph.<strong>p</strong> </p>
<p>When tags like <strong>font</strong> and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification,it started a nightmare
for web developers . Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page , became 
a long and expensive process.</p>
<p>To solve this problem , the World Wide Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
<p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

<p>The style defination are normally saved in external .css  files.</p>
<p>With an external stylesheet file , you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
